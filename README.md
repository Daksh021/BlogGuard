Blog Application – Spring Boot
Overview

This project is a backend-focused Blog Application built using Spring Boot, created to apply and solidify core backend concepts through a real-world use case. The application implements secure user authentication, authorization, and verification while following RESTful design principles and relational database modeling.

The goal of this project was to move beyond theory and gain hands-on experience by building a realistic, production-style backend system.

## Key Features

User registration and login

Account verification workflow

Authentication and authorization using Spring Security

RESTful API design

Relational database with foreign key relationships

## Tech Stack

Language: Java

Framework: Spring Boot

Security: Spring Security

API Style: REST

Database: SQL (Relational Database)

Architecture Overview

Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)

REST APIs for client-server communication

Entity relationships modeled using foreign keys

Secure endpoints with role-based access control

## Database Design

Users table for authentication and identity management

Related domain tables linked via foreign keys

Referential integrity enforced at the database level

## API Overview

The application exposes REST endpoints for:

User registration and authentication

Account verification

Blog-related operations

(All endpoints are secured where required using Spring Security.)

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

Implementing Spring Security in a real application

Designing RESTful APIs
